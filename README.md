# Dynamic City Generation Tool - COMP3013 Group Project

## Project Background
The purpose of our project is to allow game developers to create towns/cities using a town/city generation brush tool. We want to develop a unity tool which decreases the time it would take to create an immersive video game world. Most generation tools restrict developers by simply randomly generating buildings within specific X/Y coordinates. We wish to remove these restrictions and allow users to design their worlds like painting a canvas. Below is a list of features which have been discussed in our group.
